            <h1>Working with Strings</h1>
            <p>Strings are a fundamental data type in Python and can be used to store and manipulate text. Here are some
                common operations and tasks you can perform with strings in Python:

            </p>
            <h2>Creating Strings:</h2>
<p>You can create strings in Python by enclosing text in single quotes (') or double quotes ("). For example:</p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    single_quoted_string = 'This is a single-quoted string.'
                    double_quoted_string = "This is a double-quoted string."
</code>
            </pre>
            <h2>String Concatenation:</h2>
            <p>You can concatenate (combine) strings using the + operator:</p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    str1 = "Hello"
                    str2 = "World"
                    result = str1 + " " + str2  # Concatenate with a space in between
                    print(result)  # Output: "Hello World"
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>String Indexing:</h2>
            <p>Strings are indexed, meaning you can access individual characters by their position (index) within the string. Indexing starts at 0 for the first character:</p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    my_string = "Python"
                    first_char = my_string[0]  # Access the first character ('P')             
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>String Slicing:</h2>
            <p>You can extract a portion of a string using slicing. Slicing allows you to specify a range of indices to extract a substring:    </p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    my_string = "Python"
                    substring = my_string[1:4]  # Extracts characters at index 1, 2, and 3 ('yth')                 
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>String Length:</h2>
            <p>You can find the length (number of characters) in a string using the len() function:</p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    my_string = "Hello, World!"
                    length = len(my_string)  # Length is 13
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>String Methods:</h2>
            <p>Python provides various methods for working with strings, such as split(), strip(), lower(), upper(), replace(), and more. These methods allow you to manipulate and modify strings as needed.</p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    my_string = "   Hello, World!   "
                    stripped = my_string.strip()  # Removes leading and trailing spaces
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>String Formatting:</h2>
            <p>You can format strings using f-strings (Python 3.6+) or the format() method:</p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    name = "Alice"
                    age = 30
                    formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

                </code>
            </pre>
            <h2>String Escape Characters:</h2>
            <p>Python uses escape characters to represent special characters within a string. For example, \n represents a newline, and \" represents a double quote:</p>
            <pre class="code">
                <code class="a">
                    my_string = "This is a line.\nThis is a new line."
                </code>
            </pre>

        </div>

                <h1>Simple Input and Output Statements</h1>
                <p>In Python, you can use the input() function for getting user input and the print() function for displaying output. Here's how to use them:</p>
                <h2>Input Statements:</h2>
                <h2>Using input():</h2>
                <p>The input() function is used to accept user input as a string. You can then convert the input to the desired data type if needed.</p>
                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="a">
                        user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
                        print("Hello, " + user_input + "!")                        
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the program prompts the user to enter their name, and the input is stored in the variable user_input. It is then displayed as part of a greeting.</p>
                <h2>Output Statements:</h2>
                <h2>Using print():</h2>
                <p>The print() function is used to display output in Python..</p>
                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="a">
                        print("Hello, World!")                       
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>You can print strings, variables, and expressions using print(). For example:</p>
                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="a">
                        name = "Alice"
                        age = 30
                        print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, variables are combined with strings using commas in the print() statement.</p>
                <h2>Formatted Output:</h2>
                <p>You can format the output using f-strings (Python 3.6+), which allow you to embed expressions inside string literals.</p>
                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="a">
                        pname = "Bob"
                        age = 25
                        print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")                                             
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Alternatively, you can use the .format() method to format strings:</p>
                <pre class="code">
                    <code class="a">
                        name = "Charlie"
                        age = 35
                        print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
                                             
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>These are the basic input and output statements in Python. They allow you to interact with users by receiving input and displaying information in your programs.</p>

                    <h1>Python Functions and Modules</h1>
                    <p>In Python, functions and modules are important concepts for organizing and structuring your code, making it more modular, reusable, and maintainable. Here's an overview of Python functions and modules:</p>
                    <h2>Functions:</h2>
                    <p>A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parameters enclosed in parentheses. Here's the basic syntax of a function:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code class="a">
                            def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
                            # Function code goes here
                            # ...
                            return result  # Optional

                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>function_name: This is the name of the function.</p>
                    <p>parameters: These are values that the function can accept as input. Parameters are optional, and a function can have zero or more of them.</p>
                    <p>return: A function can optionally return a value using the return statement. If no return statement is used, the function returns None by default.</p>
                    <h2>Example of a simple function:</h2>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code class="a">
                        def greet(name):
                            return f"Hello, {name}!"
                        
                        message = greet("Alice")
                        print(message)  # Output: "Hello, Alice!"
                        
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <h2>Modules:</h2>
                    <p>A module is a Python file that contains a collection of functions, classes, and variables. Modules are used to organize code into separate files, making it easier to manage and reuse code. You can create your own modules or use built-in Python modules and libraries.</p>
                    <p>To use a module in your Python script, you need to import it using the import statement. Here's the basic syntax:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code class="a">
                            import module_name
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>For example, to import the math module, you would use:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code class="a">
                            import math

                            result = math.sqrt(25)
                            print(result)  # Output: 5.0
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>You can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the from keyword:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code class="a">
                            from module_name import function_name

                            result = function_name()
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>For example, to import the sqrt function from the math module:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <code class="a">
                            from math import sqrt

                            result = sqrt(25)
                            print(result)  # Output: 5.0
                        </code>

                        <h1>Loops in Python</h1>
                        <p>Certainly! Loops in Python are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. They help in automating repetitive tasks and make the code more concise. There are two main types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.</p>
                        <h2>For Loops:</h2>
                        <p>For loops are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or set). The basic syntax is:</p>
                        <pre class="code">
                            <code class="a">
                                fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                                for fruit in fruits:
                                    print(fruit)
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <h2>While Loops:</h2>
                        <p>or loops are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or set). The basic syntax is:</p>
                        <pre class="code">
                            <code class="a">
                                count = 0
                                while count < 3:
                                    print("Count is", count)
                                    count += 1

                            </code>

                        <h1>Important Notes:</h1>
                        <h2>Indentation:</h2>
                        <p>In Python, indentation is crucial to indicate the block of code that belongs to the loop. It is typically four spaces or a tab.</p>
                        <h2>Infinite Loops:</h2>
                        <p>Be careful with while loops to avoid infinite loops. Make sure to include a mechanism to break out of the loop.</p>
                        <h2>Range Function:</h2>
                        <p>The range() function is often used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers.</p>

                                File handling in Python is quite flexible, supporting various modes and formats. You can handle different types of files such as text files, CSV files, JSON files, etc., using appropriate functions and libraries.</p>

                                <p>Recursion in Python is a programming concept where a function calls itself in its own definition. Recursive functions break down a problem into smaller instances of the same problem and solve each instance independently. Recursion continues until it reaches a base case, which is a condition where the function stops calling itself.</p>

                                        <p>In this example, modify_variable is a function that takes a parameter x. When you call this function with modify_variable(my_variable), the value of my_variable (which is 5) is passed to the function. Inside the function, a new local variable x is created, and the assignment x = 10 modifies the local variable within the function.</p>
                                        <p>However, this modification does not affect the original variable my_variable outside the function. This is because integers in Python are immutable, and when the function modifies the value of x, it doesn't change the actual object in memory; it creates a new object with a new reference.</p>
                                        <p>If you were working with mutable objects like lists or dictionaries, modifications made to the object inside the function would be reflected outside the function because the reference to the same object is passed.</p>
